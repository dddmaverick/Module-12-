# Python OOP Task – Module 12
In this progect I use Python to make a class called `Flower`.

## Files
- **Flower.py** – This file has the code. It makes a class with a name and two actions: grow and bloom. I made 3 flowers: Rose, Daisy, and Sunflower.
- **PythonOOP.png** – This is a screenshot. It shows my code and how it works when I run it.

## What I did
I wrote comments for each line of code. I added my name and the date. I also added one more flower.
